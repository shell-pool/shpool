/// These allow you to do stuff like inject telemetry into the daemon
/// or trigger background processes based on a particular session
/// name (for example you could update and re-build a repository n
/// minutes after your `devserver` session disconnects on the assumption
/// that the user is done for the day).
///
/// Hooks are invoked inline within the daemon's control flow, so
/// you MUST NOT block for extended periods of time. If you need to
/// do work that could block for a while, you should spin up a worker
/// thread and enqueue events so the hooks can be processed async.
///
/// It would be nicer if the hooks took `&mut self`, but they are called
/// from an immutable context and it is nice to avoid the syncronization
/// / interior mutability unless it is required. Users can always get
/// mutable state with a cell / mutex.
///
/// Any errors returned will simply be logged.
///
/// All hooks do nothing by default.
